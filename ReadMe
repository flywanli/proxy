For the http_client.c
●	Command line is in the following format: /client.o  <proxy address> <proxy port> <URL to retrieve>
●	Connect() used to connect to server
●	Domain name and page name are separated from URL
●	GET function sent to proxy server 
●	Date recieved from server is stored in a recvfile.txt


For the http_server.c
●	Command line is in the following format: /server.o <proxy address> <proxy port> 
●	Bind() used to connect to client while connect used for connecting to web server
●	Select() used to multiplex between different client request
●	QueryCache () Handles functions within a cache-  insertion,deletion,getting data from cache
●	Depending upon the output of QueryCache()-
○	 Webpage is sent from cache
○	 Webpage requested from web server
○	 Webpage modified using conditional GET
